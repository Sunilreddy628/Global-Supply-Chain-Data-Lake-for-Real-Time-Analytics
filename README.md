Global Supply Chain Data Lake
Project Description
This project implements a centralized Data Lake for a global supply chain, consolidating data from over 20 different sources. The system is designed to process over 1 TB of data daily, enable real-time analytics, and reduce costs through optimization strategies.

Objectives
Centralize global supply chain data in a Data Lake.
Process and validate data in real-time using Databricks and PySpark.
Enable fast queries and real-time analytics using BigQuery.
Optimize storage in Snowflake to reduce costs by up to 50%.
Project Architecture
(Add a diagram here later)

Main Components
Data Ingestion: Connecting to multiple data sources.
ETL/ELT Processing: Data cleansing, validation, and transformation in PySpark.
Storage:
Delta Lake for intermediate data.
Snowflake for optimized storage.
Analytics: BigQuery and Google Data Studio for real-time reporting.
Optimization: Use partitioning and compression to minimize costs.
Technologies Used
Processing: Databricks, PySpark
Storage: Delta Lake, Snowflake
Real-Time Analytics: BigQuery, Google Data Studio
Orchestration and Validation: Apache NiFi, Apache Airflow (optional)
Languages: Python, SQL

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Installed on your machine.
Databricks: Cluster setup.
Snowflake: Access credentials.
BigQuery: Project set up on Google Cloud.
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-user/global-supply-chain-data-lake.git
cd global-supply-chain-data-lake
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your credentials in the configs/config.yaml file.
Run the Project
Run the script to generate sample data:
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/generate_sample_data.py
Load the data into the Raw Zone using PySpark.
Run the transformations to move the data into the Clean Zone.
Analyze the data from Snowflake or BigQuery.
Screenshots
(Include screenshots of the dashboards, results, or pipelines running)

Next Steps
Improve automation: Implement orchestration with Apache Airflow.
Add more data sources: Integrate more datasets to enrich the analysis.
Implement Machine Learning: Predict demand and optimize logistics.
